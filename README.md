# Jump King Recreation

This is a project made by Team Hutao, formed by Isaac Ram√≠rez and Xavier Chaparro, with the objective of recreating the platformer video game Jump King in SDL2.

In this first release of the game, our team has included the first 5 levels (not zones!) of the game, with a simple movement mechanic featuring a jump option, even though it isn't the original jump mechanic (we plan to add it in future releases). To complete the levels, you just need to do the same as in the original game: reach the top of the level, and it will automatically change to the next one.

We also added some debug features for testing purposes and to help the player: {Show collisions, god mode, limit FPS (30 FPS), die}.

Controls:

MOVE: a (left), d (right)
JUMP: Space

Debug Features:

Show Collisions: F1
God mode: F2
Limit fps (30fps): F3
Die: F4
